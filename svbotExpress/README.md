# posist_crm_meanstack
It's a assignement  to build a web app using mean stack.

I strived a lot to complete but is seems it will take more time because i have to explore on mongo db.

But most of the part i have done with node server and angular with html pages.


posist_crm_meanstack\server 
node server.js

And access through http://localhost:2233

You will not able to see more stuff but you can dig into the code.

And i'm having problem with $q which i am resolving becase success is deprecate in the version i'm using .
